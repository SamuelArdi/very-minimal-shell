# Avershi Shell
A very minimal shell with incredibly few commands, this project was made for the coding sloth weekly challenge. Although i'm incredibly late this has been a great and fun learning experience.

Currently only works with linux. Maybe I'll add windows support later on, i dunno.

Doesn't work with external commands, only the ones built in which are:
1. exit - exits the shell
2. echo - prints the input
3. pwd - prints contents of the current directory
4. cd - change directory
5. chex - check if file in directory is executable
6. append - open file in another directory without changing current directory
7. run - run a file in current directory
8. runl - run a file by giving file location (path)
9. {file_name} - if given a filename inside of the curly braces, will check if the file is inside of the directory and if it's executable

Extra commands made by me and not required for the challenge:
1. help - shows all of the commands
2. dir - shows the current directory in full path
